When Memories Get Stuck
ðŸ”Š
"When something really upsetting or traumatic happens, your brain can sometimes get overwhelmed and doesn't process the memory in the usual way. It's like the experience gets stuck, almost like a scratch on a record. Instead of becoming part of your past, it keeps playing over and over in the presentâ€”often through flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety, or a general sense of unease."

"What makes this even more painful is that the memory often gets 'stuck' with all the difficult feelings and negative beliefs that came with it at the time. For example, if something terrifying happened and you felt helpless, your brain might still carry the message: 'I'm not safe,' 'It was my fault,' or 'I'm not good enough.'"

How EMDR Helps
ðŸ”Š
"EMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing. It's a type of therapy that helps your brain do what it couldn't do at the time: fully process and 'file away' the memory so it doesn't feel so raw or intrusive."

"We do this by briefly bringing the memory to mind while using something called bilateral stimulationâ€”usually moving your eyes back and forth, or sometimes using tapping or buzzers. This seems to help the brain reprocess the memory more effectively, so it becomes less distressing and more like just another memory from your past."

"But EMDR doesn't just reduce the emotional charge. It also helps shift the beliefs attached to the memory. So, for example, a belief like 'I'm powerless' can gradually be replaced with something more balanced and true, like 'I did the best I could,' 'I'm safe now,' or 'I have strength.'"

What You Might Notice After EMDR
"As we work through the memory, you might notice it feels less sharp or overwhelming. You might still remember what happened, but it doesn't carry the same emotional weight. People often report feeling calmer, more grounded, or even surprised by how different it feels."

"Most importantly, the beliefs often start to shift. You may begin to feel more self-compassion, confidence, or a sense of closure that didn't seem possible before."

"We always go at your pace, and you'll be supported every step of the way. EMDR is powerful, but it's also gentle and respectful of your experience."
