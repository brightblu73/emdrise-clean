Hi Agent, please implement the following features for my EMDR app. Each item is described with the function I want and the required code elements:

1. **Visual BLS – Eye Tracking with Speed Control**
   - Create an animation of a ball or dot moving left to right across the screen and back.
   - Include a slider that lets the user adjust the speed (e.g., fast, medium, slow).
   - This will be used during reprocessing.

2. **Auditory BLS – Alternating Beeps with Volume Control**
   - Create a toggle that starts and stops alternating left/right beep sounds.
   - Add a volume slider so users can adjust the audio level.
   - This should work with headphones for true bilateral effect.

3. **Tapping Instructions for Tactile BLS**
   - Display text instructions explaining how to perform the butterfly tap or thigh tapping.
   - Optionally include a simple animated icon or graphic showing the rhythm.
   - Add a timer pulse or metronome (e.g., left/right flashing text or dot) if feasible.

4. **Save Preferred BLS Type**
   - When a user selects their preferred BLS method (visual, auditory, tapping), save this selection using `localStorage`.
   - Retrieve it later to auto-load their preferred method.

5. **‘Which BLS Should I Use?’ Guide**
   - Add a small button that opens a modal or popup with brief descriptions:
     - Visual: for people who like tracking movement
     - Auditory: good for eyes-closed or low-vision
     - Tapping: helpful when wanting to stay grounded in the body
   - Keep it short and client-friendly.

6. **Session Timer or Set Counter**
   - Add a visual counter that starts when the user begins reprocessing.
   - Allow the therapist or client to track how many sets of BLS have been done (e.g., 1 of 24).
   - Optionally add an estimated timer (e.g., 45 seconds per set) that counts down or up.

Please implement each feature as a modular component if possible. Let me know once they’re added or if any part needs clarification.
